# Frontend Prototype of DHSTTOS

Design files are on the `design` branch.

## How to Fire This Up

1. Install dependencies with `npm i` (please don't use `yarn`)
2. Run `npm start`
3. Go to the URL printed in the console

## Recommended Tools

- **IDE** - VS Code
- **Node** - v10.13.0 or above

For VS Code, I've got a `.vscode` folder for all the recommended extensions for this project. If you open up this project as a workspace, VS Code should automatically prompt you about installing the recommended extensions. Click "OK" or "Yes" will do :)
