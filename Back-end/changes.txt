changes from Design docs


Reasons:
convinience : 1
data format : 2
unexpected complexity : 3	

MongoConsumer Class:
    
    Changes:
    
	MongoConsumer(user, pass, dbName) #1
	added DBname for creating a reference to pass onto the MongoClientMediator
	
	getAllTopics() -> getAllTopicsPartitions() #1 & #3
	returns a Collection of topic partitions essentially to force kafka to send all records from the start, convinient becuase it relegates topic creation to another method. it was complex to make kafka read all the topics from the beginning.
	

	Additions:
	ArrayList<String> getTopicsForProcessing() #3 & #1
	there are some topics in kakfka which are for internal use like __consumeroffsets this returns the topics we need to process
