changes from Design docs


Reasons:
convinience : 1
data format : 2
unexpected complexity : 3	

MongoConsumer Class:
    
    Changes:
    
	MongoConsumer(user, pass, dbName) #1
	added DBname for creating a reference to pass onto the MongoClientMediator
	
	getAllTopics() -> getAllTopicsPartitions() #1 & #3
	returns a Collection of topic partitions essentially to force kafka to send all records from the start, convinient becuase it relegates topic creation to another method. it was complex to make kafka read all the topics from the beginning.
	

	Additions:
	Methods:
	ArrayList<String> getTopicsForProcessing() #3 & #1
	there are some topics in kakfka which are for internal use like __consumeroffsets this returns the topics we need to process
	
	Variables:
    private KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer; #1
    other funcitons need to use the consumer 
	
MongoClientMediator Class:

MANY leave for end

PacketRecordDesFromKafka Class:
    same as design

PacketRecordDesFromMongo Class:
    Date Timestamp #2 

split it two to handle different formats, the correct one and the one from ankush.

All other records stayed the same:


ProcessData class:

    Methods:
    public static void processData(String collectionName, MongoClientMediator clientMediator) #3 & #1

    added MongoClientMediator as param cause several clients might want to process data
    
    public static void processData(ArrayList<String> collectionNames, MongoClientMediator clientMediator) #1
    
    convinience cause we get a list of topics, so a list of collections to be processed, this calls processData for each topic.
    
    removed variable MongoClientMediator client.
    
    
IAggregator Class:

    Methods:
    
    public ArrayList<Document> processData( ArrayList<Record> records); #3

    changed return type to an array of documents to be added into mongo. it was unspecofied in the Design Document
    
    public Document getNewAggregatorDocument(Date tstmp); #3
    
    Variables:
    
    private ArrayList<Map<String, Object>> connectionsMapList; #1
    private Document currentDocument; #1
    
    These both are simply there to keep track of which document is being processed now and which connections happened within this second.
